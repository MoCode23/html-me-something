                    <h2>Growing Up</h2>
                    <p>To start my story, we must first look back to one of the things that shapped me the most. High School! I went to Clayton High in St. Louis, MO. Before graduating with a 3.1 GPA, I delved into various activities like Track & Field, Wrestling, Choir and Theatre. Growing up with these templates in my life, I knew that there was so much more out there in the world for me to see.</p>

                    <h2>Fighting for what's right</h2>
                    <p>After graduating high school and a small, 1 semester, stint at Saint Louis University, I was lost. I had no way to guide myself to make my life as meaningful as I wanted it to be. So, I decided to join the military. The US Air Force to be exact. I trained and ran, shot a plethera of guns and learned how to guard our nation's nuclear warheads. And after all of that I still found myself disconected from the world. I was fighting for a good cause, America, but I thirsted for something more.</p>

                    <h2>Living My Best Life</h2>
                    <p>After a while I grew tired of military life. I came back home to St. Louis, MO and decided to pick up where I left off. I wanted to be on a stage more than anything. So I decided to make that happen. I began perfoming again but this time with all the flair that I wasn't allowed to exert in high school. Since then I've found a calling, which is to be in the spotlight! I love the attention and the crowds seem to get a good kick out of it. I even have a stage name! Anyone can look me up on <a href="https://www.facebook.com">facebook</a> as Don White. </p>
